For this assignment I came accross images from collections in my gallery and decided to use them to create the site. I wanted to emphasize my favorite things to follow which is motorsports. For this assignment I used chatGPT to formulate the pages, in such a manner as we've done in the first in-class assignments that we have done during week 1. The difficulties I faced were with the no css requirement as I couldn't really get it to a functional organized page without the use of css. During the use gpt, it was specified to use html, therefore css was used as there is many styling functions. Also, syncing the images of the website was sort of challenging. Frankly, I have ran out of time and just couldn't get all the images to sync, so there are maybe half of the intended images actually on there.
